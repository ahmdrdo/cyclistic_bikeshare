## About This Repository

<img align="left" width="110" height="100" src="gallery/cyclistic_logo.jpg">Cyclistic is **a fiction company** I used in this case. Cyclistic operates a bike-share program in Chicago with more than 600 docking stations. Cyclistic has flexibility in its pricing plans by offering single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase sing-ride or full-day passes are referred to as **casual riders**. Customers who purchase annual memberships are **Cyclistic members**.

Lily Moreno, the director of marketing and my manager for this case, set a plan to **design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into members**. In order to do that, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders diﬀer, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could aﬀect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

## Notes on Analysis

My work in this analysis focused to **identify how annual members and casual riders diﬀer**. Insights from this analysis will be used to help the marketing in building their marketing strategies.
